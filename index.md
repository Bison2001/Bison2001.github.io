## About
I'm a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at UIUC. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from UCSD. During my undergraduate study, I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) on fields of explainable machine learning. My research focuses on instance-based interpretability methods like influence function.
