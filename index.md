## About
I'm a fourth year undergraduate student studying Statistics and Data Science at UCSD. Beginning fall 2023, I will join UIUC as a Ph.D. student in Statistics. I'm primarily interested in the broad areas of machine learning. My research focus is explainable AI, specifically, instance based interpretability method like influence function. I'm also interested in application of machine learning algorithms in CV and NLP.
