		<h1>Investigation of deforestation in US national forest</h1>
    <li><p>ArcGIS Python API, Vector analysis, Raster analysis, Machine Learning</p></li>
		<p>I worked with Judy Jin in this project. This project investigates the degree of deforestation in each US national forest and identifies
      the reasons that may contribute to the deforestation. The project is divided into three parts. The first part is vector analysis: we
      collect features such as fire severity, beetles, climate, and population in each US national forest. The second part is raster analysis:
      we analyze the sentinel-2 image for each national forest and use ndvi value to estimate the deforestation score for each national forest.
      The third part is predictive modeling. We build a machine learning model to predict the deforestation score based on the feature we collected.
      We interpret the p-value for the regression coefficient and understand how each factor may contribute to deforestation.</p>

		<h2>Predict the win probability of basketball games by alternating renewal reward process</h2>
    <li><p>Completed paper, Web-scraping, Stochastic process, Monte Carlo Simulation, ELO</p></li>
		<p>This is an individual paper. I used alternating renewal reward process to model the basketball games and Monte Carlo Simulation to
      predict the win probability. The data are possession based data from 2020-2021 season NBA regular season games. Different from previous work,
      my model considers the dependent relationship between possession time and scores per possession and makes special adjustment to the effect of
      home court advantages under the influence of pandemics by incorporating ELO rating system. Results show that compared with pure ELO forecast
      our model produces a better forecast indicated by 40% less MSE</p>
