		<h2>Implementation of TracInIdeal and Influence function on Linear Model</h2>
    <li>Stochastic Gradient Descent, TracInIdeal, Influence function</li>
		<p>I implemented a stochastic gradient descent algorithm on a linear model, and used it to compute TracInIdeal as described in
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08484">this paper.</a> I also implemented the influence function method in this linear model.</p>

		<h2>Count the number of stars in the sky</h2>
    <li>K-means, Outliear in sub-region, DFS, opencv</li>
		<p>At one night, I took some photos for the stars at LaJolla shore. I was curious about how many stars are in my photo. So, I tried to implement
      a K-means algorithm to classify the stars in the sky and other dark area. The result is not very ideal. Then, I proposed a solution that cuts
      the image into several sub-regions and find outlier pixels in these sub-regions. It is not only effective but also efficient.
      In this way, I was able to identify the stars in the sky. Finally, I used a DFS algorithm to count the number of star in the sky.
